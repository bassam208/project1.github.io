    <h3>Who is CR7?</h3>
    <p style="border: dotted goldenrod 6px;">Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on February 5, 1985, in
        Madeira, Portugal to Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro and José Diniz
        Aveiro. Cristiano has an elder brother, Hugo and two elder sisters,
        Elma and Liliana Cátia. His name was inspired by the former
        US-president, Ronald Reagan, whom his father was influenced by.
        
        The island of Madeira was also the place where Cristiano first learned
        to master his skills as a footballer. He spent his early years playing
        for his local team, Nacional, and by the time he turned 12 years old,
        he already made his name for himself as one of Madeira's top
        footballers . It wasn't long before he started to catch the attention
        of other big Portuguese clubs. Among Sporting was Benfica, a team
        Cristiano and his father followed as a young boy. However he eventually
        chose to play for Sporting which was a team his mother loved and
        followed as she was growing up, to play with the likes of Figo was the
        dream for her son.
        
        He was then spotted by former Liverpool manager, Gerard Houllier at the
        age of sixteen but Liverpool had no intentions to sign him at that time
        because they thought he was too young and he needed more time to
        develop his skills. However, in the summer of 2003, when Sporting
        played against Manchester United and defeated them, Cristiano caught
        the attention of Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.
        
        Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player.
        Initially, he requested for the number 28 as his jersey number because
        he didn't feel that he could live up to the pressure of previous
        players such as George Best and David Beckham who wore the number 7
        jersey.
        
        The year 2006 to 2008 proved to be a rather controversial year for the
        star. In the 2006 World Cup, Cristiano faced accusations regarding his
        sportsmanship. In a quarter-final match against England, he was heavily
        criticized for sending of his club team mate, Wayne Rooney who was
        playing for the England team. It wasn't too long until fans started
        accepting Cristiano again. In 2007, he won PFA Young Player of the
        Year, PFA Player of the Year, PFA Fans' Player of the Year, Portuguese
        Footballer of the Year, FWA Footballer of the Year, Sir Matt Busby
        Player of the Year and Manchester United's Players' Player of the Year.
        The year 2008 also saw him taking back the PFA Player Of The Year Award
        for the second time running. That same year, Ronaldo also had to deal
        with controversies regarding his club transfer to Spanish giants, Real
        Madrid. He eventually chose to stay with Manchester United and stressed
        to the public that he had no intentions of leaving the club.
        
        Cristiano now lives with his cousin, Nuno and his brother in law Ze.
        When he is not on the field, he is a very family oriented person.
        Growing up, when he was about to choose football as his career, he said
        that it was very difficult for him as that would mean lesser time with
        his family, especially his mother, whom he says play a major role in
        his life.
        
        During his free time, Cristiano enjoys cooking. He mentioned in an
        interview that he usually cooks before he leaves for his soccer
        practice. Because he is constantly training, Cristiano rarely has time
        to watch TV. If he does get the time to watch, he says he loves
        watching one of the local Portuguese game show which is mostly about
        trivia questions. Cristiano is an avid learner and he takes interest in
        learning new things everyday. Among Cristiano's biggest pet peeves are
        smoking, people who don't make an effort and dishonesty.
        
        When the tsunami hit South East Asia, Cristiano flew to Indonesia to
        help those in need. He auctioned off a few stuff to help raise funds
        for charity. He hopes to get involved in more charity projects in the
        future because he believes his star status will help him reach out to
        others for help.</p><br><br>
